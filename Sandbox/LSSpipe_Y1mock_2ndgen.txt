#pseudo pipeline describing how LSS catalogs get created from 2nd gen mocks, including all different flavors

#1st cutsky mocks get created from boxes and have the Y1 tiles list applied to geometry (Aurelio, others add details)
#These are combined across tracers, have columns added necessary for fiberassign, and have the targeting mask applied via
https://github.com/desihub/LSS/blob/main/scripts/mock_tools/prepare_mocks_Y1.py
#(Aurelio can add more details)

source /global/common/software/desi/desi_environment.sh main
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/LSS/py

#Each realization can be passed through to find potential assignments, using the actual Y1 hardware specifications, via
https://github.com/desihub/LSS/blob/main/scripts/getpotaY1_mock.py --realization <mock number>
srun -N 1 -C cpu  -t 04:00:00 -q interactive --account desi python scripts/getpotaY1_mock.py --realization <mock#>

#The output will be all of the potential assignments from the mocks, for all tracers, and including all repeats
#Each takes ~20 minutes

#Add LRG veto, takes ~3 minutes per mock
srun -N 1 -C cpu  -t 04:00:00 -q interactive --account desi python scripts/readwrite_pixel_bitmask.py --tracer lrg --input <mock#> --cat_type Ab2ndgen

#Make complete LSS catalogs with goodhardware and imaging veto masks applied
#Code does randoms in serial, 4 are likely enough
python scripts/mock_tools/pota2clus_simp.py  --veto _gtlimaging --realization 0 --maxr <max_num_ran_needed>
